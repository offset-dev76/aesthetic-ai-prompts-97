                The Beginning
              </h2>
              <p className="text-ash leading-relaxed mb-4">
                It started with a sketchbook and too much time spent people-watching. 
                I noticed how certain jewelry seemed to carry stories—not because 
                of its price or provenance, but because of how it sat with the wearer.
              </p>
              <p className="text-ash leading-relaxed">
                Those early sketches weren't about creating accessories. 
                They were about capturing the feeling of wearing something 
                that felt like an extension of thought rather than decoration.

                The Process
              </h2>
              <p className="text-ash leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Each piece begins the same way: with a question rather than an answer. 
                What would confidence look like if it had weight? How would memory 
                catch light?
              </p>
              <p className="text-ash leading-relaxed">
                We work in small batches, often just dozens of a design. 
                Not because of artificial scarcity, but because attention 
                to detail requires attention itself.
